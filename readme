Math::Project_3D version 1.004
==============================

INTRODUCTION

This distribution allows the projection of points of a three dimensional
function of an arbitrary number of parameters onto an arbitrary plane.
The function is compiled from three component functions (anonymous
subroutines containing arbitrary Perl code) by Math::Project_3D::Function
using some black magic and code generation for performance reasons.

The module relies heavily on the Math::MatrixReal module. Without it,
you would not see this realized.

Detailed documentation can be found as pod in the module files.
