Math::Project_3D::Function -
Generate anonymous subroutines for use as functions with Math::Project_3D

=head1 VERSION

Current version is 1.002. Beta software. Use at your own risk.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Looks like a screw
  my $function = Math::Project_3D->new_function(
    'u,v',     # list of parameter names
    '$u',      # first component
    'sin($v)', # more components
    'cos($v)',
  );
  
  # or as an anonymous sub / closure!

      # This is a sphere

      my $z_component = sub {
          my $theta = shift;
          return $radius * cos($theta);
      };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package contains the code for generating anonymous subroutines
for use as functions with the Math::Project_3D module. The package
has no public subroutines and you should use it indirectly through
the C<new_function> method of Math::Project_3D.

Oh, yes, I almost forgot. I<Do not read the source>. :-)
